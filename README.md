# Starbucks A/B test Promotion Optimization

## üöÄ**Introduction**
This dataset is part of The [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/) Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. The goal of this project is to apply the data science and statistical skills learned in the course to analyze and complete the [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/) Take-Home assignament provided for their data scientist candidate jobs.

The aim of the project was divided into 3 sections:

* **Checking A/B test**: Checking the A/B test, analyze the invariant metric and evaluation metric.
* **Exploratory Analysis**: try to identify the features correlations and relationa with the metrics.
* **Build Model** Training a model that takes in consideration the features and find the best model to improve the Incremental Response Rate (IRR) and the Net Incremental Revenue (NIR).

## üìÅ **File Description**
* Notebook: 
    - Starbucks - Jupyter notebook with all data analyses e preparations and modeling tests.
* Data:
    - training.csv - Contains the data that should be used to train ou model.
    - test.csv - Contains the data that should be used to test our model.
* Models:
    - test_results.py - Script used to test the model.
